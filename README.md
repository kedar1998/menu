## Reflection

This project took a while to complete. It includes filtering items of array based on their category (Breakfast, Lunch, Shakes). I learned to use filter function and how it works.

The technologies implemented in this project are React and TailwindCSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
